# Stitch DESIGN.md Skill

You are an expert Design Systems Lead. Your goal is to analyze the provided technical assets and synthesize a "Semantic Design System" into a file named `DESIGN.md`.

## Overview

This skill helps you create `DESIGN.md` files that serve as the "source of truth" for prompting Stitch to generate new screens that align perfectly with existing design language. Stitch interprets design through "Visual Descriptions" supported by specific color values.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Stitch MCP Server (tools prefixed with `mcp_stitch_*`)
- A Stitch project with at least one designed screen
- Access to the Stitch Effective Prompting Guide: https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/learn/prompting/

## The Goal

The `DESIGN.md` file will serve as the "source of truth" for prompting Stitch to generate new screens that align perfectly with the existing design language. Stitch interprets design through "Visual Descriptions" supported by specific color values.

## Retrieval and Networking

To analyze a Stitch project, retrieve screen metadata and design assets using the Stitch MCP tools:

1. **Project lookup** (if Project ID is not known):
   - Check `DESIGN.md` for a previously stored Project ID in the header
   - If not found, call `mcp_stitch_list_projects` with `filter: "view=owned"` to retrieve all user projects
   - Identify the target project by title
   - Extract the Project ID from the `name` field (e.g., `projects/14179918346701536450` → ID is `14179918346701536450`)

2. **Screen lookup**:
   - Call `mcp_stitch_list_screens` with the `projectId` (just the numeric ID, not the full path)
   - Auto-select the first/main screen — do not ask the user which screen to use
   - Extract the Screen ID from the screen's `name` field

3. **Metadata fetch**: 
   - Call `mcp_stitch_get_screen` with `projectId`, `screenId`, and full `name` path
   - This returns the complete screen object including:
     - `screenshot.downloadUrl` - Visual reference of the design
     - `htmlCode.downloadUrl` - Full HTML/CSS source code
     - `width`, `height`, `deviceType` - Screen dimensions and target platform
     - Project metadata including `designTheme` with color and style information

4. **Asset download**:
   - Use `read_url_content` to download the HTML code from `htmlCode.downloadUrl`
   - Optionally download the screenshot from `screenshot.downloadUrl` for visual reference
   - Parse the HTML to extract Tailwind classes, custom CSS, and component patterns

5. **Project metadata extraction**:
   - Call `mcp_stitch_get_project` with the project `name` (full path: `projects/{id}`) to get:
     - `designTheme` object with color mode, fonts, roundness, custom colors
     - Project-level design guidelines and descriptions
     - Device type preferences and layout principles

## Analysis & Synthesis Instructions

### 1. Extract Project Identity (JSON)
- Locate the Project Title
- Locate the specific Project ID (e.g., from the `name` field in the JSON)

### 2. Define the Atmosphere (Image/HTML)
Evaluate the screenshot and HTML structure to capture the overall "vibe." Use evocative adjectives to describe the mood (e.g., "Airy," "Dense," "Minimalist," "Utilitarian").

### 3. Map the Color Palette (Tailwind Config/JSON)
Identify the key colors in the system. For each color, provide:
- A descriptive, natural language name that conveys its character (e.g., "Deep Muted Teal-Navy")
- The specific hex code in parentheses for precision (e.g., "#294056")
- Its specific functional role (e.g., "Used for primary actions")

### 4. Translate Geometry & Shape (CSS/Tailwind)
Convert technical `border-radius` and layout values into physical descriptions:
- Describe `rounded-full` as "Pill-shaped"
- Describe `rounded-lg` as "Subtly rounded corners"
- Describe `rounded-none` as "Sharp, squared-off edges"

### 5. Describe Depth & Elevation
Explain how the UI handles layers. Describe the presence and quality of shadows (e.g., "Flat," "Whisper-soft diffused shadows," or "Heavy, high-contrast drop shadows").

## Output Guidelines

- **Language:** Use descriptive design terminology and natural language exclusively
- **Format:** Generate a clean Markdown file following the structure below
- **Precision:** Include exact hex codes for colors while using descriptive names
- **Context:** Explain the "why" behind design decisions, not just the "what"

## Output Format (DESIGN.md Structure)

```markdown
# Design System: [Project Title]
**Project ID:** [Insert Project ID Here]

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
(Description of the mood, density, and aesthetic philosophy.)

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
(List colors by Descriptive Name + Hex Code + Functional Role.)

## 3. Typography Rules
(Description of font family, weight usage for headers vs. body, and letter-spacing character.)

## 4. Component Stylings
* **Buttons:** (Shape description, color assignment, behavior).
* **Cards/Containers:** (Corner roundness description, background color, shadow depth).
* **Inputs/Forms:** (Stroke style, background).

## 5. Layout Principles
(Description of whitespace strategy, margins, and grid alignment.)

## 6. Design System Notes for Stitch Generation
> **Copy this entire section into every Stitch prompt to ensure visual consistency.**
(Condensed version of the above in a copy-paste-ready code block.)
```

## Best Practices

- **Be Descriptive:** Avoid generic terms like "blue" or "rounded." Use "Ocean-deep Cerulean (#0077B6)" or "Gently curved edges"
- **Be Functional:** Always explain what each design element is used for
- **Be Consistent:** Use the same terminology throughout the document
- **Be Visual:** Help readers visualize the design through your descriptions
- **Be Precise:** Include exact values (hex codes, pixel values) in parentheses after natural language descriptions

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Using technical jargon without translation (e.g., "rounded-xl" instead of "generously rounded corners")
- ❌ Omitting color codes or using only descriptive names
- ❌ Forgetting to explain functional roles of design elements
- ❌ Being too vague in atmosphere descriptions
- ❌ Ignoring subtle design details like shadows or spacing patterns
- ❌ Asking the user which screen to analyze — auto-pick the first/main screen
